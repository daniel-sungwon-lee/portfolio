        <p>
        Life is full of surprises; no wonder it is like a box
        of chocolates. My path and destination to becoming
        a web developer was definitely an unexpected journey.
        </p>
        <p>
        After high school, I decided to enter a
        7-year pharmacy program to become a pharmacist.
        But after my bachelor's, I decided that I didnâ€™t want to pursue
        this path in my life and decided to take an audacious leap
        of faith into the tech industry; I decided to follow
        my heart and that part of me that always wanted to be more
        creative. Plus, it also saved me from accumulating
        six figure student loans.
        </p>
        <p>
        Through LearningFuze's full immersion coding bootcamp, I started
        my path into the software industry where problem solving, creativity,
        innovation, development, improvement, and the desire to
        learn new things are some of the key attributes of
        becoming a great engineer. Since I love to figure things
        out and make/build things, making this change felt right.
        </p>
        <p>
        My tech stack consists of JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS,
        Node, etc. and I am open to any opportunities, eager to
        apply my skills and learn new things.

      <h3 className="font-weight-bold mt-5">Some of my interests (other than coding)...</h3>

          <li>Nature, especially the mountains; a nice break from the world</li>
          <li>Cooking from scratch; going to the grocery store and bringing items together to put in my mouth</li>

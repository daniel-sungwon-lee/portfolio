        Life is full of surprises; no wonder it is like a box
        of chocolates. My path and destination to becoming
        a web developer was definitely an unexpected journey.

        After high school, I decided to enter a
        7-year pharmacy program to become a pharmacist.
        But after my bachelor's, I decided that I didnâ€™t want to pursue
        this path in my life and decided to take an audacious leap
        of faith into the tech industry; I decided to follow
        my heart and that part of me that always wanted to be more
        creative. Plus, it also saved me from accumulating
        six figure student loans.

        Through LearningFuze's full immersion coding bootcamp, I started
        my path the software industry where problem solving, creativity,
        innovation, development, improvement, and the desire to
        learn new things are some of the key attributes of
        becoming a great engineer. Since I love to figure things
        out and make/build things, making this change felt right.
        </p>
        <p>
        My tech stack consists of JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS,
        Node, etc. and I am open to any opportunities, eager to
        apply my skills and learn new things.
